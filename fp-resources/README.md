# A Curated List of FP Learning Resources

Recently we've been asked to compile a list of learning resources for people just starting their journey into FP. Let's get it started! PR's welcome!!

### Courses
* [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1) is a great beginner course. It is the first course of the [Functional Programming in Scala Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala)
* Bartosz Milewski's [Lectures on Category Theory](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_). Video lecture series, presenting the material from his "Category Theory for Programmers" blog.
* Erik Meijer's [Introduction to Functional Programming](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-functional-programming-delftx-fp101x-0) is mind expanding!  This goes pretty deep for an "introduction", so I would recommend Functional Programming Priniples in Scala first if you're nervous.  This course also uses Haskel as it's teaching tool, but that a good thing!  (PS. Erik Meijer is the driving force behind Microsoft LINQ... which is pretty darn cool, and really helps show the power of FP)

### Books
* I highly recommend [The Red Book](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala) by Paul Chiusano and Runar Bjarnason. It's not overly advanced, and no prior Scala knowledge is required as they take you through a journey on concepts and then explain how Scala can be used to implement.
* If your doing Haskell, then [Learn You Haskell for the greater good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) is pretty darn useful.

### Blogs
* [Runar's Blog](http://blog.higher-order.com/)
* Bartosz Milewski's [Category Theory for Programmers](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/). A very accessible presentation, with examples in Haskell and C++. Part 1 is not too advanced, but by part 3, things get fairly abstract.

### Videos
* Brian Lonsdorf's [Classroom Coding with Prof. Frisby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_tkIpwbsxY) Some good examples of functional JavaScript in a fun way!  Brian also goes by the pseudonym Dr. Boolean
