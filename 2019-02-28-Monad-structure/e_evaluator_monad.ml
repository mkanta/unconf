(* By now you probably noticed the same pattern :

 M >>= fun a -> n

Exception:
  eval_exception_m ti >>= fun i ->
  eval_exception_m tj >>= fun j ->
  if j=0 then
    except "Division by zero"
  else
    unit (i/j)

State:
   eval_state_m ti >>= fun i ->
   eval_state_m tj >>= fun j ->
   tick >>= fun () ->
   return_s (i/j) 

Logging:
   eval_output_m ti >>= fun i ->
   eval_output_m tj >>= fun j ->
   log (sprintf "Div %d %d => %d\n" i j (i/j)) >>= fun () ->
   unit (i/j) 

*)


type term = Cons of int | Div of (term * term)
                                 
let rec eval' = function
  | Cons i -> i
  | Div (ti,tj) -> (eval' ti) / (eval' tj)

type 'a i = 'a                                 
                                 
let (>>=) : 'a i -> ('a -> 'b i) -> 'b =
  fun a f ->
  f a
                                 
let rec eval = function
  | Cons i -> i
  | Div (ti,tj) ->
     eval ti >>= fun i ->
     eval tj >>= fun j ->
     i/j

(* Thoughts

- We can achieve purity writting code that is very similar to impure

- Monad captures effect: state, generate output, raise an exception, etc


- Monads capture "effects" (or computations) and compose them
  - how do you model monads?


- You can compose values, but also functions. E.g. the State Monad:

  ('a, 'b) state -> ('a -> ('c, 'b) state) -> ('c, 'b) state
  
  is actually

  'b -> ('a, 'b) -> ('a -> 'b -> ('c, 'b)) -> 'b -> ('c, 'b)

- In your day to day, which other computations could be written as compositions?
  - how do you find those use cases? Exception, Logging and State are well known uses
  - There are other forms of composition: function composition, monoids

- "the structuring methods presented here would have been 
discovered without the insight afforded by category theory. But once discov-
ered they are easily expressed without any reference to things categorical"
