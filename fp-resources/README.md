# A Curated List of FP Learning Resources

Recently we've been asked to compile a list of learning resources for people just starting their journey into FP. Let's get it started! PR's welcome!!

### Courses
* [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1) is a great beginner course. It is the first course of the [Functional Programming in Scala Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala)

### Books
* I highly recommend [The Red Book](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala) by Paul Chiusano and Runar Bjarnason. It's not overly advanced, and no prior Scala knowledge is required as they take you through a journey on concepts and then explain how Scala can be used to implement.

### Blogs
* [Runar's Blog](http://blog.higher-order.com/)
